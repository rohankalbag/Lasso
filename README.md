## Course Project - CS 101 - Computer Programming and Application - Autumn Semester 2020 - Indian Institute of Technology Bombay 
### Course Instructor - Prof. Bhaskaran Raman 

Operating System Supported - Linux (Ubuntu)

The source code to a game was was provided and features had to be added and enhancements had to be made to the provided code in order to earn an AA grade in the course.

### Enhancements made:

- Developed a user friendy GUI for user to access various features, this can be used to play the game, view instructions, view the leaderboards, made using initCanvas() from simplecpp

- Added feature of lives, the user is given 3 lives at the start and after the lives become zero the game terminates and displays the user's score and Game Over message.

- Added the feature of bomb, bomb is a sprite that on catching with lasso deducts 1 life.

- Increased the number of coins from 1 to (4 coins + 4 bombs).

- Modified the bombs and coins in such a way that they follow a random path and get resetted randomly after exiting the playable area (earlier the coin would just go in a straight line repeatedly)

- Introduced feature of leaderboards the players names and scores are updated after each game, sorted in descending order in the file leaderboards.dat.

This project was succesfully accepted and I was awarded the AA grade for this course.
